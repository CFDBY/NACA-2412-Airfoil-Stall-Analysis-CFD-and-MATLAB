## 🧪 Results Overview

### ✅ Lift & Drag Coefficients (CFD Results)
| AoA (°) | Cl (CFD) | Cd (CFD) |
|--------:|---------:|---------:|
| 0       | 0.37     | 0.022    |
| 5       | 0.45     | 0.019    |
| 10      | 0.53     | 0.020    |
| 12      | 0.54     | 0.020    |
| 15      | 0.55     | 0.019    |
| 18      | 0.54     | 0.018    |
| 20      | 0.54     | 0.018    |
| 18 (Transient) | 0.56 | 0.018 |

> **Note:** Although theoretical models predict a sharp stall after 12°, our CFD results show more gradual variation. This is due to real-world viscous effects captured by CFD. The relatively stable Cl at high AoA may also reflect mesh resolution limitations; improving mesh quality would yield more accurate stall modeling.

```matlab
% Thin airfoil theory + parabolic drag model validation
rho = 1.225;
V = 60;
AoA_deg = [0 5 10 12 15 18 20];
AoA_rad = deg2rad(AoA_deg);

> **Limitation:** Theory diverges after stall (≈12°), emphasizing the importance of CFD.

## 💬 Observations & Notes
- **Mesh Scaling** in Fluent is crucial. Incorrect scaling caused Cd and Cl to be exaggerated initially.
- Post-stall CFD results significantly differ from theoretical predictions due to stall and flow separation effects.
- The results were more consistent and accurate after improving mesh quality and refining simulation settings.
- Residuals in transient simulations were smoother than expected due to symmetric flow field stabilization.

## 💬 Final Observations
In this study of a NACA 2412 airfoil under high-angle-of-attack conditions, computational constraints limited the mesh resolution and iteration count, preventing the accurate capture of stall characteristics. Specifically, the mesh was not sufficiently fine to resolve the boundary layer and flow separation phenomena, with a y+ value exceeding the recommended threshold of 1. Additionally, the low number of iterations likely led to incomplete convergence. To adequately capture stall, a timestep size of 0.0001 with approximately 300,000 iterations would have been required, as suggested by typical best practices in CFD literature. As a result, the computed lift and drag coefficients may overestimate lift at higher angles of attack, limiting the reliability of performance predictions. These limitations were imposed to balance computational cost with simulation feasibility. Future work could employ adaptive mesh refinement and a higher iteration count to better resolve stall behavior.
