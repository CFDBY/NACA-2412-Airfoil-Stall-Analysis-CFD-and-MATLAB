# NACA-2412-Airfoil-Stall-Analysis-CFD-and-MATLAB
Investigates NACA 2412 airfoil aerodynamics using ANSYS Fluent CFD and MATLAB. Analyzes lift/drag coefficients across AoA to identify stall angle. Uses ~120k quad mesh, k-omega SST model. MATLAB applies Thin Airfoil Theory. CFD captures post-stall behavior (~12Â°). Includes animations, residuals, Cl/Cd plots.
